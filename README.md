# IPL Score Prediction

**Description:**  
Predict IPL match final scores using mid-game statistics and machine learning models.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

**Project Overview:**  
Predict final scores using features like runs, wickets, overs, last-5-over stats, and team/venue info. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and predictive system.

**Workflow:**  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Convert overs to balls, one-hot encode categorical variables  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Train-test split  
- Linear Regression & Random Forest Regressor model building and evaluation  
- Predictive system for sample matches  

**Highlights:**  
- End-to-end workflow  
- Visualized actual vs predicted totals  
- Predict IPL match scores
